The code files for my dataset and Machine Learning model for my project for TNJSF.

Here is the drive link to the text file of the joint locations of the four-bar, six-bar, and eight-bar linkage systems for the Machine Learning pipeline using Fourier Descriptors, Wavelet Descriptors, and (x,y) points on the curve: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ave_nD11YWyKRb4ygaHdYKLut1RlcTtc/view?usp=share_link

Here is the drive link to the images of the synthesized coupler curves of the mechanisms: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NGsEyE0xRnurBknl1GHvG1hpmQssQSPv/view
